Compilers
=========

This project is a compiler for a subset of python that emits x86 assembly. The
compiler was written in python and consists of two parts.  The original
compiler called backslashx90.hw6 and the implitly parallilized compiler
backslashx90.

This was for a school project at the University of Colorado at Boulder. This
code can not be duplicated for any student use. It is only to be used as a
historical record for everything Nic and Josh did.
